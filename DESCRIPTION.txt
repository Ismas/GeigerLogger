INTRODUCTION
------------
    This contains the schematics and Arduino sketch for a Geiger counter with the folowing capabilities:
    
    * CPS, CPM and uSV real time counting with 1 second update and real measurements, not extrapolations.
    * ... CPM shows last minute counting and uSv/h last hour counting.
    * Battery backed real time clock to date each measurement.
    * Internal EEPROM storage for last 140h - 200h, not contiguous.
    * ... that leads to accumuilative dosimeter function by selecting an hour range.
    * Serial console for data dumping and configuring.
    * GPS capable for accurate radio mapping of areas (not yet included in this version)
    * Software programmable HV voltage to accomadate several GM tubes.
    * ... with CPM to uSv/h configurable conversion rate. 
    * Of course, light and beep event notificator.
    * Portable, battery powered, low consumption (~50mA)
    * Temperature and battery sensing.
